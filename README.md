# Claire Pointer

...is a tiny animation of the Blackthorn City Gym Leader, Claire, originally debuting in the games Pokemon Gold and Silver for the Gameboy Color in 1997. Every pixel is placed MANUALLY by directly accessing the display registry in GBA mode 3. This is all to say, it took literally forever to make! That said, I just did it for fun, its really not all that impressive.

## Controls
- UP - Speed up animation
- DOWN - Slow down animation

## How to run
A Gameboy Advance, or GBA emulator is required to play this animation.
I recommend mGBA as that's what we used in class.
I've only uploaded the final Project.gba ROM.
If you have the physical hardware to run it, you totally can!
This has been tested on a real working GBA, just plop the ROM file into a microSD / SD slot cartridge and voila!
